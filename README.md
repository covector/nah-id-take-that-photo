## 🏔️ About
Take a selfie to upload to get likes! However, there's a catch. The location you've found is on top of a treacherous mountain. One false move and you'll tumble down hundreds of meters.
*<div align="center">"Nah, I'd take that photo."</div>*

Embrace that idea and scale upon the mountain to show the world. You did it!
